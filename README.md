First project made in HACK A BOSS with HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT by Cristina, Eneko, Alexiel and Cristina.

The project consists of a memory game in which you have to discover 8 pairs of emojis that are hidden by clicking on them. If they match, they will remain uncovered, otherwise they will rotate again.
